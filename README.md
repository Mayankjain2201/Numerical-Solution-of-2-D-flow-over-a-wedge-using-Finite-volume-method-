# Numerical-Solution-of-2-D-flow-over-a-wedge-using-Finite-volume-method-

This file contains the code to simulate te flow over a 15 deg. wedge at Mach no. of 2.5 using Van-leer FVS.
Finite volume approach is used to discretise the domain.
Transfinite Interpolation method is used to create the mesh.
the different contour plots are made to visualise the changes in field variables.
